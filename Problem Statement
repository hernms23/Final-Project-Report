To avoid fraud, track provenance, and guarantee accountability in many digital and physical asset exchanges, keeping an open and unchangeable record of ownership is essential. 
Conventional centralized systems are susceptible to transaction history inaccuracies, duplicate spending, and data manipulation. For artifacts, this project mimics a 
blockchain-based transaction system in which every transaction is stored in a block that is protected by cryptography. The system demonstrates the concepts of blockchain, 
proof-of-work, and object-oriented architecture by enforcing rules for transaction validation, preserving historical ownership records, and preventing unauthorized or 
fraudulent activity.

Key Challenges Addressed:

Securing transaction records against tampering

Ensuring artifact provenance is verifiable

Implementing proof-of-work mining for block validation

Modeling stakeholders and ownership changes in a scalable, object-oriented manner
