# Final-Project-Report
Project Name: Blockchain-Based Artifact Transaction System  Technologies: Java, Github

Description & Goals
1. Created a blockchain simulation using essential blockchain ideas like hashing, mining, and chain verification to trace the origin and transactions of digital artifacts.
2. Used object-oriented classes to model stakeholders, artifacts, and transactions while managing ownership, balances, and transaction validation.
To guarantee block integrity and chain security, proof-of-work mining was implemented with an adjustable difficulty prefix and automated validation.
3. Created dynamic programming logic to enforce provenance checks, validate transaction rules, and stop fraud.
4. Created a console-based interface that shows each block's transaction data, block hashes, and blockchain states in real time.
