Conclusion/Reflection:
Technical Skills: Developed proficiency in Java programming, SHA-256 hashing, and algorithmic problem-solving. Learned to structure classes effectively to model stakeholders, artifacts, and transactions.
Problem-Solving & Algorithms: Implemented proof-of-work mining and chain verification logic, which strengthened my understanding of computational thinking, iteration, and verification of data integrity.
Software Design: Practiced modular and maintainable code design, improving readability, scalability, and testing within a complex simulation.
Reflection on Challenges: One challenge was ensuring proper provenance checks and transaction validation without breaking the chain logic. Addressing this improved my ability to debug complex systems and enforce business rules programmatically.
Professional Growth: This project strengthened my ability to translate theoretical concepts (blockchain, digital ledgers) into practical code, preparing me for more advanced software engineering and technical research tasks in future projects.
